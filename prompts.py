        2. Job description (enclosed in ^^ delimiters)

        OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:

        - Aligning experience bullets with job requirements
        - Incorporating relevant technical keywords
        - Quantifying achievements where possible but not required
        - ALWAYS Maintaining consistent X,Y,Z format

        - Preserves all LaTeX formatting commands
        - Maintains section structure
        - Follows bullet point constraints
        - Includes relevant keywords
